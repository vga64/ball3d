## Installation
**How To Install**

Just click to chosen version of any patch on "Download" section.

After installation, extract zip to "...\Steam\steamapps\common\Ball 3D\Ball 3D_Data" and replace "Assembly-UnityScript.dll". That's it!

**Reliability**

Do you think about safety? For sure it is safe, you can scan all files with any anti-virus client. e.g. virustotal

## Building Specific Modules
If you don't trust .dll files or if you want to make some other mods with my edited classes - you can build your one!

First of all, you have to install **.NET decompiler**, to open and edit your **.dll** file. I recommend **dnSpyEx**, but you can also use **dnSpy** which is outdated. (**dotPeek** and **ILSpy** are alternatives)

1) https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/releases
2) https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases

(Advanced Users can also use **ghidra**.)

Secondly, open **dnSpy** and load **Assembly-UnityScript.dll** file from your game directory. (And dive into dnSpy. Try to learn! It will be helpful)

Thirdly, you have to change some of classes. Look inside of the **Assemblies** folder in the repository. There are **.cs** files in **Assemblies** folder. Install which you need.

Now you have to find all classes of the **Assembly-UnityScript.dll** file from dnSpy (generally classes are in: **{}**). Replace your chosen assemblies (.cs files) with **Assembly-UnityScript.dll** classes.

When you finish replacements, only thing to do is **saving all modules**. Good luck!

**Warning!** Some of classes have strong restrictions to recompile, as an example: **GlobalManager**. If you want to build your .dll, then you have to use some techniques for replacing chosen assembly with game .dll's class. You can contact with me from discord: **yoareh**. I am here for your all questions.

## Using Edited Classes/Modules

Do you want to make your own mod project with my edited classes/modules? Sure you can use the classes/modules, but please give credit to me about these. Nothing more I want :)
