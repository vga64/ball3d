## enhancedFps
**How To Install:**

*Just click to chosen version of enhancedFps on "Download" section.*

*After installation, extract "0.x.zip" to "...\Steam\steamapps\common\Ball 3D\Ball 3D_Data" and replace "Assembly-UnityScript.dll". That's it!*

**Is This Safe:**

*Sure! It is safe, you can scan all files (config.txt | Assembly-UnityScript.dll) with any anti-virus client. e.g. virustotal*

## enhancedFps + Corrected Shift
*This is same with enhancedFps, just a merged version of it!*

## Don't You Trust?
*If you don't trust .dll files, you can build it yourself!*

First of all you have to install decompiler, to open and edit your .dll file. I recommend dnSpyEx, but you can also use dnSpy which is outdated.
